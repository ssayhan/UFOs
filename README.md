## UFOs SIGHTINGS ANALYSIS

JavaScript interactive web-page

### Overview

Dana wants to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.  We will help Dana to make this webpage. We planned to use javascript to display the data as a table and add table filters for the city, state, country and shape. Beside JavaScript we will use also following to build the dynamic web-page:

-	HTML to build the webpage
-	Chrome Developer Tools to test the code
-	CSS and Bootstrap to build style the page

### Resources

-	Data Source: JavaScript
-	Software : VS Code and Chrome Developer Tools
-	Language: JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap
-	Dependences : D#

### Results

User can search using Data Criteria and check details

### Summary

I think there are still room for improvement

-	We can improve filter part like letter sensitive. We could add our search capital letter or smaller letter sensitivity. Like we can write CA or Ca instead of ca.
-	We can also add reset search/filter button.
